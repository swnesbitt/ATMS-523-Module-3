## Scott Andersen - Module 3 Assignment - ATMS 523 

Both questions are answered in Jupyter Notebook HW3.ipynb in this
directory. I select data from a station in Grand Rapids, Michigan
and calculate the requested values in the function aggregate_station_data.

This assignment reused some code provided in M3N1_intro_to_cloud_pandas.ipynb 
to select a station that had sufficient data entries.

This notebook can easily be executed using jupyter notebook as long
as matplotlib and pandas are installed.

Data was used from NOAA's Global Historical Climatology 
Network - Daily (GHCN-Daily), Version 3.
